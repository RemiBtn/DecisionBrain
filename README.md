# DecisionBrain
This repository is a student project at the CentraleSup√©lec engineering school in France.
The goal was to optimize the task planning for workers who have to perform tasks in different locations, taking into account various constraints (working hours, travel time, workers' skills, etc).

## Structure
- the **data** directory contains Excel files for different instances
- the **ST7_V1, ST7_V2** files are the notebooks where our optimization code and analysis is done
- the **models_v1.py, models_v2.py ...** files contain employee and node classes for different phases of the project
- the **utils.py** file contains utility functions used in the project
- the **results** directory contains solutions formatted in the required format
